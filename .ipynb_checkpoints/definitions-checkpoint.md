## Definitions

**[Pokemon go gym](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Gym)** is a place where a Pokemon can workout. Each gym tends to specialize for a special type of Pokemon. 

> the question has arisen as to whether players can make their own Gyms. While players can’t do this instantly, as it would lead to a pretty intense influx of Gyms and upset of the PokeCoin economy, they can submit a request for a new Gym location here. Only businesses can be submitted, but it’s worth a shot if your area is low on Gyms.

> Hopefully you don’t live too far away from your local Gym, but in case you can’t spot one from where you live, go for a quick walk or car trip around your neighborhood. Niantic has been pretty good at placing Gyms relatively close to most populated areas, even if you live in a small town. Just remember to stay safe and aware while you’re out adventuring.
